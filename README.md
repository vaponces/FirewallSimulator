# FirewallSimulator
In this assignment, I wrote a personal firewall simulator for IPv4 packets. The simulator is capable of filtering both incoming and outgoing packets. This program reads a specified configuration file, then reads lines from standard input and outputs results to standard output.This program reports a warning when there is an error and ignores the offending line, but it continues to run.

To compile you do:
python3 fw.py [rules filename] < [packets filename]
